        <h1>RIZAL PARK, BEACON HILL, SEATTLE</h1> <br>
        <p> Following the Spanish-American War in 1899, the United States assumed control of the Philippine Islands from Spain. Seeking better economic opportunities, many Filipinos migrated to the U.S. In Seattle, they, along with other Asian and African Americans, faced racial discrimination. Many Filipinos secured work in the fish canneries of the Northwest and Alaska. By 1973, the Filipino Alumni Association petitioned the city to honor Dr. Jose Rizal in recognition of his role in Philippine independence (Wilma, 2001). </p></div>

        <h1>RIZAL PARK, HEIDELBERG, GERMANY</h1> <br>
        <p> Rizal arrived in Heidelberg (a historic city in Germany) on February 3, 1886 from Paris, where he marked several important milestones in the city. In the spring of 1886, Rizal attended lectures in Ophthalmology in the ancient university town of Heidelberg, Germany. In the same year, on April 22, 1886 to be exact, he wrote his nostalgic poem “A Las Flores de Heidelberg” and finished writing the last chapters of his first novel. In order to save rent from expensive boarding houses near the university, he started correspondences with German Pastor Karl Ullmer who invited him to stay in his vicarage in Wilhelmsfeld (about 20 minutes away from Heidelberg). In this unassuming German town, Rizal established a great friendship between the Philippines and Germany which remains to this day (Philippine Consulate General in Frankfurt, 2021; Roda, 2017)­.

        <h1>CAMPBELLTOWN CITY, SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</h1> <br>
        <p> There is a new Rizal Park and it is in Australia, serving to “light the way” for 220,000 Filipino migrants who have found refuge on a continent far away from home. The Rizal Park sits on 2.6 hectares of the Government’s reserved land. Its centrepiece is a giant five-metre statue of Jose Rizal donated by renowned Filipino Sculptor Eduardo Castrillo.

        <h1>RIZAL PARK, JINJIANG, CHINA</h1> <br>
        <p> In Jinjiang, Fujian, China, Rizal Park stands as a meaningful tribute that honors Jose Rizal’s Chinese ancestry. His great-great-grandfather came from Fujian as an immigrant. The park includes a towering monument crafted from Jinjiang granite, modeled after the original Luneta Monument (Alcantara, 2019).

        <h1>JOSE RIZAL PARK IN LIMA, PERU</h1> <br>
        <p> In 2008, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo inaugurated the first Jose Rizal Park in Lima, Peru. It is the first public park in Peru named after a national hero of a foreign country and the first to have such a monument. The bronze bust was designed by Czech sculptor Libor Piszlac who hails from Litomerice in the Czech Republic. It was donated by Hans Gunter Schoof — a German married to a Filipina from Baclayon, Bohol — who was a passionate admirer of Rizal. The bust is mounted atop a quadrilateral pedestal, decorated with four inaugural plaque markers on each side. Inscribed in one marker are the words: “Dr. Jose P. Rizal, Heroe Nacional de Filipinas, Nacionalista, Reformador Political, Escritor, Linguistica y Poeta, 1861-1896” (Villareal, 2022).
