        <h1>MEXICO CITY</h1> <br>
        <p> To celebrate the historic ties between the Philippines and Mexico, a striking statue of Dr. Jose Rizal is prominently displayed in a serene area of Lomas de Chapultepec, positioned at a key intersection of Paseo de la Reforma and Montañas Rocallosas Ote. Crafted by Costa Rican-Mexican artist Francisco Zuñiga, this tribute to the Filipino national hero was unveiled on 12 June 1967. Dr. Rizal, who traveled to Mexico in 1890, found deep inspiration in the country's struggle for independence from Spanish rule and held great admiration for the bravery of Mexican revolutionaries such as Miguel Hidalgo and Jose Maria Morelos. His statue serves as a lasting reminder of his role in the push for Filipino freedom from colonial oppression in the late 19th century, perpetually honoring the connection between the two countries (Villareal,2022).
