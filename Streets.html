        <h1>DR. JOSE RIZAL AVENUE, CHICAGO </h1> <br>
        <p> In 1994, the City of Chicago conferred the honorary designation “Dr. Jose Rizal Avenue” on a segment of Irving Park Road, extending from Oak to Clark Street. This act commemorated the 150th birth anniversary of Jose Rizal, a figure of considerable historical significance. The rededication ceremony was officiated by representatives of the Philippine Consulate General, alongside Illinois Representative Mike Quigley and Alderman Ameya Pawar. Jose Rizal’s connection to Chicago, while brief, is noteworthy. During his transcontinental journey across the United States—from San Francisco to New York—Rizal arrived in Chicago on May 11, 1888, at 8:14 a.m. He departed that same evening at 8:25 p.m. Although his visit spanned less than a single day, it remains a point of historical interest. A commemorative marker is located at 1332 W. Irving Park Road, near the Rizal Center, memorializes both Rizal’s visit and the street’s honorary naming (GMA News, 2011).

        <h1>RIZALSTRASSE, WILHELMSFELD, GERMANY</h1> <br>
        <p> In 1886, José Rizal, notable as the Philippine national hero, resided for approximately three months in Wilhelmsfeld, a small town located about 20 kilometers from Heidelberg, while pursuing ophthalmology studies. During this period, Rizal stayed at the vicarage of Pastor Karl Ullmer. Not only did he complete the concluding chapters of his influential novel, Noli Me Tangere, under Ullmer’s roof, but he also celebrated his 25th birthday with the Ullmer family, with whom he developed a close friendship. Rizal took the opportunity to improve his command of the German language, even translating German literary works into Tagalog. In recognition of Rizal’s significant connection to the town, the street in front of Pastor Ullmer’s former residence was officially named Rizalstraße in 1964 (Embassy of the Philippines, Berlin, 2017; (Rocamora, 2024).

        <h1>CALLE DE JOSE RIZAL, MADRID, SPAIN</h1> <br>
        <p> Between October 1882 and mid-1885, José Rizal pursued studies in medicine, philosophy, and letters at the Universidad Central de Madrid. During his time in the city, he resided at various addresses, including Calle Amor de Dios and Calle Fernández y González. Rizal’s stay in Madrid was marked not only by his academic endeavors but also by his pivotal role in the Propaganda Movement. Through Spanish-language works such as La Solidaridad, Noli Me Tángere, and El Filibusterismo, he advocated reforms in colonial governance, freedom of expression, and legal equality for Filipinos. These writings contributed significantly to the intellectual discourse of his era .The significance of Rizal’s legacy was formally recognized on December 5, 1996, when a street in Madrid was dedicated to him as part of the commemorations leading up to the Philippine Centennial of Independence. Today, Calle de José Rizal serves as a gathering place for the Filipino community in Madrid, hosting cultural and community events.The street’s current name results from a decision by the Madrid City Council on May 4, 2007, which followed recommendations made by the Commission on Historical Memory and Spain’s Historical Memory Law (Law 52/2007).The significance of Rizal’s legacy was formally recognized on December 5, 1996, when a street in Madrid was dedicated to him as part of the commemorations leading up to the Philippine Centennial of Independence.
