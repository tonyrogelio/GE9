        <h1>SYNTHESIS/CONCLUSION</h1> <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The global prestige that the monuments, busts, streets, and parks have in the name of Jose Rizal marks his relevance worldwide and contributions to this age and other ages as well as countries, such that his history may be preserved in the places he traveled to or occupied while embodying what he stood for. A plaza in Germany alongside Paris' bust and Singapore's statue display fragments of his historical legacy. The display represents his journeys together with his literary works and his active fight along with his ideas for Filipino independence and colonial peoples' dignity. The works Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo extend their influence beyond Philippine borders. These literary works address social wrongs together with power corruption and administrative abuses which persist into the present era. Several sites across the world function as memorials to people who dedicated their lives to building a superior tomorrow. They have sparked movements for freedom, equality, and justice. These landmarks stand as testaments to a man whose writings ignited a revolution and whose legacy has shaped national pride and identity, especially for Filipinos living abroad. To honor at least one Filipino hero is not just Rizal, as there are monuments worldwide but really symbols of a much bigger vision of enlightenment and liberation and as a call to the visual memory, reflection, and action wherever we are.
